                <h2>Body Scan</h2>
                <p>Find a quiet place and sit or lie down comfortably. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. Slowly scan your body from head to toe, paying attention to any sensations or tension. If you find any areas of tension, gently focus your breath on those areas and try to release the tension.</p>

                <h2>Mindful Breathing</h2>
                <p>Sit comfortably and close your eyes. Focus your attention on your breath. Notice the sensation of the air entering and leaving your nostrils or the rise and fall of your chest or belly. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring your focus back to your breath.</p>

                <h2>5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique</h2>
                <p>Take a moment to ground yourself in the present by using your senses. Identify and name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This helps you connect with your surroundings and stay present.</p>

                <h2>Mindful Walking</h2>
                <p>Take a walk outside, paying full attention to the experience. Notice your steps, the air on your skin, and the sounds around you. Stay present and let each step ground you in the moment.</p>

                <h2>Loving-Kindness Meditation</h2>
                <p>Sit comfortably and close your eyes. Begin by focusing on yourself and silently repeat phrases such as “May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I be safe.” Then extend these wishes to others to cultivate compassion and kindness.</p>
